Hi. I am co-leading the "From Text to Map" workshop at the European Summer University in Digital Humanities in Leipzig, Germany.  

For the second week of our workshop we are creating a [https://esu2016mapping.github.io/](website) to showcase some of the different experiments with mapping and visualizing geographic data and phenomena.  

Below you can find an example of our first extraction of data from a 10th century Arabic work:

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
